### About This Project

This application is for users who want the standard YouTube Music experience in a dedicated desktop window, with one key addition: showing what you're listening to on Discord.

This is **not a custom client**. It is a direct wrapper for the official YouTube Music website (music.youtube.com) and does not add any other features like ad-blocking, custom themes, or equalization. The goal is to be as minimal and lightweight as possible.
